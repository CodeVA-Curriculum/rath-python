Python code works based on *rules*. If we know how the rules work, we can experiment and learn more about how to write Python programs through *inductive reasoning*. Here are some rules that will *always* be true with Python code:

* **Python code is deterministic.** If the code is the same, the behavior produced by the computer will be the same.
* **Python code executes in a predicatable order.** Right now, the computer executes the commands written in your code *in order*, starting from line 1
* **When there's no code left, the program ends.** If the computer reading your program gets to the "bottom" of your file and there are no more commands, the computer will stop reading your program
