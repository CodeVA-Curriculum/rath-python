# Module 1: Speaking, Listening, & Remembering

This module introduces three fundamental tenets of computing: input, output, and storage. Every computing device or piece of software that you use can do these three things, and so our interactive narratives will need to as well. In practice, we will use these three things to create software that can **speak**, **listen**, and **remember** past exchanges with the reader/user.

# Backstory

In this series of modules, you will learn how to create Python programs that tell stories. Your role in this project is to *write* the narrative; you will be the author. The computer's role is to *tell* the story. In order for this relationship to work, you will need to create a script for the computer to follow; in other words, you'll have to write some code that tells the computer how to tell the story. Interactive narratives are like any other kind of software in that they need to be able to:

1. Show users different parts of the story
2. Prompt the user to interact with the story
3. Store user inputs to use later on in the story if appropriate

In this module, we will learn how to create Python programs that generate **output**, ask users to produce data as **input** to the program, and that **store** user inputs (and other kinds of data) for use later on in the program.

## Coding as a System of Representation

Coding involves writing instructions for a computer to follow. Ultimately, these instructions need to take the form of digital information--ones and zeros, high and low voltages. What we call a coding "language" is really another system of representation--not ones and zeros (like what a computer would use), and not a language humans would use. Rather, coding languages are somewhere *in between* these two types of representation. They are an interface between people and machines.

## Python as a Technology

Like all coding languages, **Python** is designed to serve as a representational medium. The people who created Python built it with assumptions about what it would be used for and what sorts of things are important about reading and writing code. These assumptions are borne out through **syntax**, the rules for writing code. Similar to how a spoken language involves putting together words with different meanings to communicate complex ideas, coding in Python involves putting together **commands** and **patterns**, which a piece of software called a **compiler** will use to create instructions for the computer.

The computer will follow these instructions, producing complex behavior based on how the commands and patterns in the code interact with one another. As long as the code follows the correct synax conventions, the compiler will create corresponding instructions for the computer. If the compiler can't figure out how to interpret the code (probably because the code failed to follow syntax rules), the code will fail and produce an error message.

[insert image of syntax error]

You'll probably experience syntax errors a lot when you're learning how to code. These moments of misunderstanding between you and the compiler can be positive and productive as you learn to communicate with one another as long as you don't let it's terseness discourage you!

# Guided Inquiry

Throughout these modules, you'll see elements like the one below. These are embedded [Repl.it]() projects, which will allow you to run and edit code on this webpage. When you reach the **[Project]()** below, you'll create a [Repl.it]() account and

# Catalyzing Questions

* Think of software that you use often. What sorts of inputs does it ask for from you, the user? What sorts of outputs does it produce? Does it store any information in the short or long term?
