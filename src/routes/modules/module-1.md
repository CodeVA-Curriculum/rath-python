# Module 1: Speaking, Listening, & Remembering

This module introduces three fundamental tenets of computing: input, output, and storage. Every computing device or piece of software that you use can do these three things, and so our interactive narratives will need to as well. In practice, we will use these three things to create software that can **speak**, **listen**, and **remember** past exchanges with the reader/user.
