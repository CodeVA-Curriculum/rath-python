# Backstory

At this point, you know a lot about how to create interactive narratives. You may have even tried to create interactive stories using just `if` statements, variables, and `input()`, which is great! It's totally possible to create some amazing stories using just those simple tools. However, you might notice that things get pretty complicated pretty quickly. Consider the program below:

```python
print("You see a dusty hallway ahead. Will you EXPLORE, or LISTEN?")
answer = input()

if answer == "EXPLORE":
    print("You find a trap door hidden beneath an old, moldy carpet.")
elif answer == "LISTEN":
    print("You just hear the creaking of the old house")
else:
    print("That's not an option")
```

This is a pretty short story; it barely rises to the level of an interactive narrative at all! The problem is, if we try to add more to the story, the program gets pretty difficult to read and make changes to. For example, we might want to have the reader make another choice after they find the trap door. To accomplish this, you'd have to add another `if` statement to the `"EXPLORE"` path:

```python
# ...
if answer == "EXPLORE":
    print("You find a trap door hidden beneath an old, moldy carpet.")
    print("Will you OPEN the door, or KNOCK?")
    answer = input()

    if answer == "OPEN":
        print("You see a dark passageway below.")
    elif answer == "KNOCK":
        print("You hear someone approach the trapdoor...")
    else:
        print("That's not an option")
elif answer == "LISTEN":
    print("You just hear the creaking of the old house")
else:
    print("That's not an option")
```

By nesting the `if` statements, we can create longer "branches" in the story. The problem is, the more nested `if` statements we add, the more complicated the code becomes! We will eventually end up with a "diagonal" code pattern:

```python
if answer =="A":
    if answer == "B":
        if answer == "C":
            # etc...
```

This sort of "diagonal" code is okay for beginners, but unless we figure out a different way to organize the code that makes up the story things will get too complicated and difficult to manage as we add to the story. Not to mention that nested `if` statements are a little confusing to read!

This module is about **functions**. We will use functions to solve the problem of nested `if` statements in our interactive narratives. By creating functions, we can organize our story into *scenes*, allowing us to freely add new parts to the story without having to create many nested `if` statements. This is the last coding concept you will need to learn in order to make interactive narratives with Python!

# Function Basics

**Functions** are really important in programming; they are *power-words* that trigger a process. You've already been using some **functions** in your programs; `print()` is a function that triggers the process of showing text on the console, and `input()` is a function that triggers the process of pausing and waiting for the user to type something before continuing with the program.

You can use Python to **define** your own **functions** instead of just using the ones built into the language. You can use functions to organize your code into *processes* that you can trigger at different points in your program. There are just a couple of steps to do. Consider this program:

```python
print("I'm going to sing you a song!")

# song lyrics
print("This is the song that doesn't end...")
print("Yes it goes on and on my friend...")

print("Thanks for listening!")
```

To demonstrate how **functions** work, I'm going to *refactor* this code so the lines corresponding to the song lyrics are organized into a function. Here's how that works:

<Steps title="1: Create Function Definition">
<span slot="text">
The first step is to create the **function definition** area at the top of the code. Here are the steps:

1. The function definition section starts with the keyword `def` (short for *define*)... 
2. ...followed by the name of the function I'm creating (this is totally up to the coder, I chose `song` because it matches the purpose of the function). 
3. After the name, I need to add a set of parentheses (this is a Python **syntax** rule, it's not optional) and a **colon** to end the line.

</span>
<span slot='code'>

```python
# new code! ------------
def song():
    # process code
    # goes here...

# old code ------------
print("I'm going to sing you a song!")

# song lyrics
print("This is the song that doesn't end...")
print("Yes it goes on and on my friend...")

print("Thanks for listening!")
```
</span>
</Steps>

<Steps title="2: Write the Function Process">
<span slot="text">
Next, I need to define the *process* that will go with the `song()` function. Any code indented beneath the function **definition** line will get mapped to the `song()` keyword.

1. First, I'll add the two `print()` statements that comprise the song lyrics to the function definition. 
2. Then, I'll remove them from the "old" section of the program.

</span>
<span slot='code'>

```python
def song():
    # new code! ---------
    print("This is the song that doesn't end...")
    print("Yes it goes on and on my friend...")

# old code ------------
print("I'm going to sing you a song!")

# the song lyrics *were* here

print("Thanks for listening!")
```
</span>
</Steps>

<Steps title="3: Activate the Function">
<span slot="text">
If you run code at this stage, you'll notice something interesting. The code indented below the function definition line *doesn't happen*. It's like our function definition code doesn't work anymore!

Never fear; this is by design. Now that I've *defined* the function, I need to *call* it in order to trigger its process.

1. First, I'll find the spot where I'd like to trigger the `song()` function (right after the `print("I'm going to sing...") statement)
2. To trigger (or **call**) the function, I need to type its name (in this case, `song()`)

</span>
<span slot='code'>

```python
def song():
    print("This is the song that doesn't end...")
    print("Yes it goes on and on my friend...")

print("I'm going to sing you a song!")

song() # new code! Activate the song() function

print("Thanks for listening!")
```
</span>
</Steps>

## Why Functions?

You might be asking yourself--"Why would I add functions to my code? It seems like a needlessly complicated addition". There are a lot of benefits to adding functions that might not be clear right away; the most obvious one is that we can *call* functions as many times as we need to *without* rewriting the function definition. So if I wanted to repeat the `song()` code, I could do it by simply calling the `song()` function a few more times:

```python
def song():
    print("This is the song that doesn't end...")
    print("Yes it goes on and on my friend...")

print("I'm going to sing you a song!")
song() # activate the song() code!
song() # activate it again!
song() # and again...
song() # and again...
print("Thanks for listening!")
```

<Callout title="Basic Function Experiments">
The program [linked here]() contains some function definitions, but only one function call. The program is incomplete; call the appropriate functions in the correct order so the program outputs the lyrics to [song](). **Fork** the code [linked here]() to get started. Your program should produce the output below when you are finished:

```
Hey Jude
don't make it bad. Take a sad song, and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start
to make it better
Na, na, na
na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na
Hey Jude
```

# Using Functions for Scenes

So how could functions help with organizing interactive narratives? There are a lot of possible ways to use functions (they're a pretty flexible programming tool), but one way is to create *scenes* within functions, and then to chain those scenes together to weave the interactive narrative. "Scenes" aren't Python concepts--they are a method of organization, a way of thinking about how to break down the problem of telling stories that have multiple paths toward multiple endings. A scene has:

* A description, where the reader learns about what is happening in that part of the story and what options they have for interacting with the narrative
* A choice, where the reader types in a command to interact with the story
* Two or more paths that lead to other scenes

You can think about an interactive narrative not as a book with different endings that you read front-to-back, but as a network of "scenes" connected together. For example, here's a network of scenes represented by a flowchart for the story [insert story name]():

<!-- TODO: add flowchart -->
[flowchart]

To create this story using Python, you could make each "scene" its own function and connect them together through the reader's choices. Here's an example:

<Steps title="1: Create the First Scene">
<span slot="text">
First, you'll need to create a scene to start the story off. Check out the example.

Each "scene" function has a couple of different parts:

1. A function definition line, where we need to name the scene
2. A `print()` statement, where we describe what's going on in the scene
3. A `print()` statement that shows the reader what options they have for interacting with the story
4. An `if` statement, with a section for each path out of the scene

</span>
<!-- TODO: Write code -->
<span slot="code">

```python
def scene1():
    print("You find yourself in a dark, musty cave")
    print("Will you EXPLORE or DEPART?")
    # check which path the user chose
    answer = input() # get user input
    if answer == "EXPLORE":
        print("You become lost in the dark")
    elif answer == "DEPART":
        print("You step out into the light")
    else:
        print("That's not an option")
```
</span>
</Steps>

<Steps title="2: Create Destinations">
<span slot="text">
The scene in the function called `scene1()` has three possible paths for the user to take:

1. EXPLORE the cave
2. DEPART the cave
3. `"That's not an option"`, which will run if the reader types something other than `"EXPLORE"` or `"DEPART"`.

Each of these paths will lead to different scenes--"EXPLORE" leads to "Scene 2" according to our flowchart, while "DEPART" leads to "Scene 3". If the reader doesn't select one of these two options, we can just restart "Scene 1" to give them another chance to answer.

Next, create new functions for `scene2` and `scene3`.
</span>
<span slot="code">

```python
def scene1():
    print("You find yourself...")
    # collapsed to make room...

def scene2():
    print("Welcome to scene 2!")
    # no "if" statement yet...

def scene3():
    print("Welcome to scene 3!")
    # no "if" statement yet...
```
</span>
</Steps>

<Steps title="3: Create Connections">
<span slot="text">
Next, we will connect each path in the scene to another scene. Basically, we want to run the code for different scenes based on the choice the reader made in `scene1()`. 

In `scene1()`, we made three possible paths:

1. `"EXPLORE"`, which leads to `scene2()`
2. `"DEPART"` which leads to `scene3()`
3. `"That's not an option"`, which leads back to `scene1()`

To connect these paths to new scenes, call the function associated with the scene that should start given each input from the reader.
</span>
<span slot="code">

```python
def scene1():
    print("You find yourself in a dark, musty cave")
    print("Will you EXPLORE or DEPART?")
    # check which path the user chose
    answer = input() # get user input
    if answer == "EXPLORE":
        print("You become lost in the dark")
        scene2()
    elif answer == "DEPART":
        print("You step out into the light")
        scene3()
    else:
        print("That's not an option")
```
</span>
</Steps>

<Steps title="4: Activate the First Scene">
<span slot='text'>

Because `scene1()` leads to all the other scenes, we don't need to include any other function calls. The `scene1()` call after all the function definitions starts sort of a chain reaction, where the process inside each function definition contains the calls to all subsequent scenes in the story.
</span>
<span slot='code'>

```python
# functions, collapsed to make room
def scene1():
    print("You find yourself...")
    # etc.

def scene2():
    print("Welcome to scene 2!")
    # etc.

def scene3():
    print("Welcome to scene 3!")
    # etc.

# main program -------
scene1() # activate scene 1
```
</span>
</Steps>

To expand the story, all you have to do is add `if` statements to `scene2()` and `scene3()`, along with more scenes to connect to. I've expanded the story I started above into a more-or-less playable interactive narrative. Play with the [Repl.it]() embedded below to get a sense of what it's like to interact with a story organized into functions this way. Definitely check out the code as well to see how things are organized! If you're interested in extending this example, you can **fork** it from [this link]().

# Catalyzing Questions

* What are some ways to help students organize complicated interactive narratives into scenes (especially away from the computer)?
* Can you think of any limitations the scene-as-function pattern creates for people creating stories?
* How might you help students move away from linear Python programs toward programs decomposed into functions?
* Are there other ways to engage students in decomposition outside of creating interactive narratives?
