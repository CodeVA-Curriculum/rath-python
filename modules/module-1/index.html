<div class="columns"><div class="blog column is-6 is-offset-3 content"><h1>Backstory</h1>
<p>In this series of modules, you will learn how to create Python programs that tell stories. Your role in this project is to <em>write</em> the narrative; you will be the author. The computer’s role is to <em>tell</em> the story. In order for this relationship to work, you will need to create a script for the computer to follow; in other words, you’ll have to write some code that tells the computer how to tell the story. Interactive narratives are like any other kind of software in that they need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Show users different parts of the story</li>
<li>Prompt the user to interact with the story</li>
<li>Store user inputs to use later on in the story if appropriate</li></ol>
<p>In this module, we will learn how to create Python programs that generate <strong>output</strong>, ask users to produce data as <strong>input</strong> to the program, and that <strong>store</strong> user inputs (and other kinds of data) for use later on in the program.</p>
<h2>Coding as a System of Representation</h2>
<p>Coding involves writing instructions for a computer to follow. Ultimately, these instructions need to take the form of digital information–ones and zeros, high and low voltages. What we call a coding “language” is really another system of representation–not ones and zeros (like what a computer would use), and not a language humans would use. Rather, coding languages are somewhere <em>in between</em> these two types of representation. They are an interface between people and machines.</p>
<h2>Python as a Technology</h2>
<p>Like all coding languages, <strong>Python</strong> is designed to serve as a representational medium. The people who created Python built it with assumptions about what it would be used for and what sorts of things are important about reading and writing code. These assumptions are borne out through <strong>syntax</strong>, the rules for writing code. Similar to how a spoken language involves putting together words with different meanings to communicate complex ideas, coding in Python involves putting together <strong>commands</strong> and <strong>patterns</strong>, which a piece of software called a <strong>compiler</strong> will use to create instructions for the computer.</p>
<p>[insert graphic]</p>
<p>The computer will follow these instructions, producing complex behavior based on how the commands and patterns in the code interact with one another. As long as the code follows the correct synax conventions, the compiler will create corresponding instructions for the computer. If the compiler can’t figure out how to interpret the code (probably because the code failed to follow syntax rules), the code will fail and produce an error message.</p>
<p>[insert image of syntax error]</p>
<p>You’ll probably experience syntax errors a lot when you’re learning how to code. These moments of misunderstanding between you and the compiler can be positive and productive as you learn to communicate with one another, as long as you don’t let it’s terseness discourage you!</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Throughout these modules, you’ll read code segments demonstrating different Python commands and patterns. We <em>highly</em> encourage you to try writing code using those commands and patterns. Talking about code can sometimes be pretty abstract; it will be helpful to pair this information with some experience. First, you need somewhere to write and compile your code!</p>
<p>Follow either set of instructions below to get set up with Python on your computer. You can either use <strong><a href>Repl.it</a></strong> (which runs in your web browser and requires a pretty good internet connection) or you can set up Python on your computer (which requires no internet after you download the software, but does involve installing unfamiliar software and may take some time). Click on one of the links below to see instructions for how to get set up with either set of tools:</p>
<ul><li>How to Use Repl.it (Recommended)</li>
<li>How to Install and Use Python</li></ul>
<h1>Speak</h1>
<p>As we discussed above, all software has some form of input and output. The first, and easiest, form of output to learn in Python is <strong>printing</strong> to something called the <strong>console</strong>. In <a href>Repl.it</a>, any messages your code says to <code>print()</code> will show up in the box to the right of where you write your code. To print to the console, we must use an aptly-named Python function (or command) called <code>print()</code>. The syntax for <code>print()</code> is as follows:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"A message to show to the user"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>You can add as many of these as you want to! Remember–these commands are the <em>script</em> your computer will follow when it tells its story. Whenever you want the computer to “speak” to the user, this is the command you will use. Your programs can get pretty verbose…</p>
<pre class="language-python"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"This is a Python program"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"All it does it output messages"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"So it might as well output a lot of them."</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Your program can include as many of these commands as you want! There are a couple of details to take note of:</p>
<ul><li><code>print(&quot;hello&quot;)</code> and <code>print(&#39;hello&#39;)</code> do the same thing; single and double quotes aren’t different in Python. Just make sure you use the same kind of quotation mark on either side of your message!</li>
<li>The name of the function you are using is <code>print()</code>, and the text inside the quotation marks is a <strong>string</strong></li>
<li>For now, you should only print <strong>strings</strong>; this means that you should always put matching quotation marks around the text you want the computer to <code>print()</code></li></ul>

<h1>Listen</h1>
<p>The programs you read about above don’t do very much; they just show information to the user via the console. Outputting text is going to be a vital component of our interactive narratives, but we also need the computer to get <em>input</em> from the user. Right now our program only instructs the computer to speak; we need to instruct the computer to listen, as well.</p>
<p>The command that tells the computer to “listen” to the user is called <code>input()</code>. Try typing the code below into <a href>Repl.it</a>, and then run the code.</p>
<pre class="language-python"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-python"><span class="token comment"># editor</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"What is your name?"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"It's nice to meet you!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>You should end up with something that looks like this in your console:</p>
<pre class="language-text"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-text">What is your name?
 
  </code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>At first glance, it seems like your program is broken; why didn’t it print the last message? The answer lies in the <code>input()</code> command. After you run your program, the computer follows the commands <em>in order</em>. When it gets to the <code>input()</code> command after printing the first message, it <strong>waits for the user to type something in to the console</strong>. Try it out for yourself; run your code, and then click over into the console area and try typing something on your keyboard. When you’re done, press <code>Enter</code> to move on with the rest of the program!</p>
<p>When you write Python programs, you can use <code>print()</code> to “speak” to the person using your program, and you can use <code>input()</code> as a way of prompting them to interact with your program. With these two commands, you can start making “interactive” programs like the chatbot below:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello! I'm your digital assistant"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"What is your name?"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment"># wait for the user to respond, then...</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Welcome! Please tell me your age, as well"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"It's so nice to meet you! How are you feeling today?"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Thanks for chatting with me!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"See you tomorrow!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token comment"># etc...</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>After the last line of your “script”, the program will end and you’ll have to press the “play” button again to interact with your Python program.</p>
<p>After adding <code>input()</code> to your programs, you can write programs that tell the computer to <em>interact</em> with the reader of your interactive narrative. Right now, these programs aren’t very “smart”; the story doesn’t change based on what the user says during those interactions. We will cover that stuff in the next two modules. For now, it’s okay to just practice writing new code on your own, and to begin thinking about what sorts of choices users might make in a story that you write.</p>

        <div class="markdown"><span style="display: none;">Try copying one of the code examples above into your code editor. Run the code, and observe the **output**. Then, try experimenting with the code to address the prompts below:
<ul><li>Try <em>starting</em> your program with an <code>input()</code> command. What are some possible problems with this pattern? Are there situations where a coder would <em>want</em> to start their program with <code>input()</code>?</li>
<li>Now try <em>ending</em> your program with an <code>input()</code> command. Is this a good or confusing design decision?</li></ul></span>

<h1>Apply Your Skills</h1>
<p>When coders only know how to use a couple of commands, their creative space is pretty small. Using only <code>print()</code> and <code>input()</code> commands is pretty limiting! Don’t worry–we will add a lot more tools to your toolbox in the (very) near future. For now, check out the prompt below, which is designed to help you practice writing Python programs that include <code>print()</code> and <code>input()</code> commands:</p>
